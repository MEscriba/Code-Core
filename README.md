- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MEscriba

I'm going to be uploading to my readme the core-code bootcamp tasks that I'm doing!!!

Week challenges (Tuesday) 

1-The difference between compiled and interpreted languages is contained in the way they interact with the computer.
In a compiled language, the target machine can read the source code without the help of another program, unlike in an interpreted language, which needs a program to understand its instructions.

2- The Java language is both compiled and interpreted.
