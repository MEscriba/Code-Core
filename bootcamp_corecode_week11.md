**WEEK 11 - NODEJS**

**MONDAY**

Understanding well what Node.JS is before starting to use it, will make it much easier for us to work with this powerful tool. In this exercise your task is to answer the following questions in your own words:

-What is Node.JS?

Conceived as an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications.

-What problem does Node.JS solve?

Node's stated number one goal is "to provide an easy way to build scalable networking programs."
the bottleneck in the entire web application architecture (including traffic throughput, processor speed, and memory speed) was the maximum number of concurrent connections a server could handle.

Node solves this problem by changing the way a connection to the server is made. Instead of spawning a new OS thread for each connection (and allocating the accompanying memory to it), each connection triggers an execution event within the Node. Node also claims that it will never deadlock, because locks are not allowed and because it does not directly block for I/O calls. Node claims that a server running it can support tens of thousands of concurrent connections.

-What is the V8 Javascript Engine?

V8 is the name of the JavaScript engine that powers Google Chrome. It's what takes our JavaScript and runs it while you're browsing with Chrome. V8 provides the runtime environment in which JavaScript runs. The browser provides the DOM and the other APIs of the web platform.

-Is Node.JS really necessary in the Development ecosystem?

Since Node.js uses fewer threads, it uses fewer resources/memory, resulting in faster execution of tasks. So for our purposes, this single-threaded architecture is equivalent to the multithreaded architecture. When one needs to process data-heavy tasks, then it makes much more sense to use multi-threaded languages ​​like Java. But for real-time applications, Node.js is the obvious choice.

-What is NVM and Why is it useful for Node.JS developers?

The nvm software allows you to install and manage different versions of NodeJS on one computer, making it easy to work with projects that require different versions.

nvm is a software that we can install to have several different versions of NodeJS on the same computer. Thanks to nvm we can install any version of NodeJS that we need in a project, be it a current version or an old version. It also allows us to exchange the version of NodeJS that we have active at a given moment, among all those that have been installed in the system.
